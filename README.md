## Blockchain Multiplayer Chess Game

The Blockchain Multiplayer Chess Game is a decentralized application (DApp) that enables users to play chess against each other on the Ethereum blockchain. The game utilizes smart contracts to manage game logic, player moves, prize pools, and winnings distribution.

### Features

- **User Registration and Authentication**: Users can create accounts by connecting their Ethereum wallets (e.g., Metamask). Robust authentication ensures secure access to user accounts.
- **Game Lobby**: Users can browse and join available chess game rooms. They can also create new game rooms and specify game settings such as time control and game variants. Real-time updates keep users informed about available game rooms and players in the lobby.
- **Chess Gameplay**: Users can engage in real-time chess matches against each other. The game fully implements chess rules, including move validation, castling, en passant, promotion, and check/checkmate detection. Real-time updates provide users with a dynamic view of the game board, moves, and game state. The platform supports popular chess variants like Blitz, Rapid, and Bullet.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Ethereum smart contracts are integrated to handle game logic and transactions. The smart contracts manage player registrations, handle moves, and distribute winnings. Player funds are securely managed within the smart contract.
- **Payment and Prizes**: To enter a game room, players must make a payment. The smart contract tracks and manages the prize pool. At the end of the game, winnings are distributed according to a predefined distribution model, such as 70% to the winner, 20% to the app owner, and 10% to the smart contract.
- **Game History and Leaderboards**: Game history, including moves, outcomes, and player statistics, is stored for future reference. Leaderboards showcase top-performing players based on various metrics such as win percentage and rating.
- **User Profiles and Achievements**: User profiles display player statistics, game history, and achievements. Players are rewarded with achievements for reaching milestones and accomplishing specific objectives.
- **Chat and Communication**: In-game chat functionality allows players to communicate during gameplay. Real-time updates notify players of their opponent's moves and game notifications.

### Technical Requirements

- **Blockchain and Smart Contracts**: The application utilizes the Ethereum blockchain for smart contract deployment and transaction handling. Smart contracts are written in Solidity, following security and efficiency best practices.
- **Front-end Development**: Modern web technologies like React.js are used for front-end development. The user interface is responsive and user-friendly, ensuring an optimal user experience. Integration with Ethereum wallet providers, such as Metamask, facilitates transaction handling.
- **Back-end and Server**: A scalable backend server handles authentication, game room management, and real-time updates. The server is capable of managing multiple concurrent game sessions efficiently.
- **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Thorough testing of smart contracts is conducted using frameworks like Truffle or Solidity testing libraries. Front-end components and game functionality are comprehensively tested. Security audits and code reviews are performed to ensure the integrity and safety of the application.
