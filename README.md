Blockchain Multiplayer Chess Game


## Introduction
The Blockchain Multiplayer Chess Game is a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to play chess against each other on the Ethereum blockchain. The game leverages smart contracts to handle the game logic, track player moves, manage the prize pool, and distribute winnings.

## Features
### User Registration and Authentication
#### Users can create an account by connecting their Ethereum wallet (e.g., Metamask).
#### Authentication mechanism to ensure secure access to user accounts.
### Game Lobby
#### Users can browse and join available chess game rooms.
#### Ability to create new game rooms and specify game settings (e.g., time control, game variant).
#### Real-time updates on available game rooms and players in the lobby.
### Chess Gameplay
#### Users can play chess against each other in real-time.
#### Full implementation of chess rules, including move validation, castling, en passant, promotion, and check/checkmate detection.
#### Real-time updates on game board, moves, and game state.
#### Support for popular chess variants (e.g., Blitz, Rapid, Bullet).
### Smart Contract Integration
#### Integration with Ethereum smart contracts to handle game logic and transactions.
#### Smart contract functionality to manage player registrations, handle moves, and distribute winnings.
#### Secure handling of player funds within the smart contract.
### Payment and Prizes
#### Players must make a payment to enter a game room.
#### Smart contract tracks and manages the prize pool.
#### Distribution of winnings to the winner(s) at the end of the game, following a predefined distribution model (e.g., 70% to winner, 20% to app owner, 10% to smart contract).
### Game History and Leaderboards
#### Storage of game history, including moves, outcomes, and player statistics.
#### Leaderboards to showcase top-performing players based on various metrics (e.g., win percentage, rating).
### User Profiles and Achievements
#### User profiles display player statistics, game history, and achievements.
#### Achievement system to reward players for milestones and accomplishments.
### Chat and Communication
#### In-game chat functionality to enable players to communicate during gameplay.
#### Real-time updates on opponent's moves and game notifications.
## Technical Requirements
### Blockchain and Smart Contracts
#### Utilize the Ethereum blockchain for smart contract deployment and transaction handling.
#### Smart contracts written in Solidity, following best practices for security and efficiency.
### Front-end Development
#### Use modern web technologies such as React.js for front-end development.
#### Responsive and user-friendly UI/UX design.
#### Integration with Ethereum wallet providers (e.g., Metamask) for transaction handling.
### Back-end and Server
#### Backend server to handle authentication, game room management, and real-time updates.
#### The server should be scalable and capable of handling multiple concurrent game sessions.
### Testing and Quality Assurance
#### Thorough testing of smart contracts using frameworks like Truffle or Solidity testing libraries.
#### Comprehensive testing of front-end components and game functionality.
#### Security audits and code reviews to ensure the integrity and safety of the application.
## Project Timeline and Deliverables

#### Integrating with Ethereum wallet providers for transaction handling.
#### Implementing chat and communication features.
### Phase 4: Backend Development and Server Setup
#### Setting up the backend server to handle authentication and game room management.
#### Establishing real-time updates between players and game sessions.
### Phase 5: Testing and Quality Assurance
#### Conducting thorough testing of smart contracts, front-end components, and overall functionality.
#### Addressing any issues or bugs discovered during testing.
#### Performing security audits and code reviews.
### Phase 6: Deployment and Launch
#### Deploying the application to the Ethereum mainnet.
#### Making the application available for users to access and play.
#### Conducting user acceptance testing and refining the application based on user feedback.
## Conclusion
