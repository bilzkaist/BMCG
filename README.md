## Blockchain Multiplayer Chess Game

The Blockchain Multiplayer Chess Game is a decentralized application (DApp) that enables users to play chess against each other on the Ethereum blockchain. The game utilizes smart contracts to manage game logic, player moves, prize pools, and winnings distribution.

### Features

- **User Registration and Authentication**: Users can create accounts by connecting their Ethereum wallets (e.g., Metamask). Robust authentication ensures secure access to user accounts.
- **Game Lobby**: Users can browse and join available chess game rooms. They can also create new game rooms and specify game settings such as time control and game variants. Real-time updates keep users informed about available game rooms and players in the lobby.
- **Chess Gameplay**: Users can engage in real-time chess matches against each other. The game fully implements chess rules, including move validation, castling, en passant, promotion, and check/checkmate detection. Real-time updates provide users with a dynamic view of the game board, moves, and game state. The platform supports popular chess variants like Blitz, Rapid, and Bullet.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Ethereum smart contracts are integrated to handle game logic and transactions. The smart contracts manage player registrations, handle moves, and distribute winnings. Player funds are securely managed within the smart contract.
- **Payment and Prizes**: To enter a game room, players must make a payment. The smart contract tracks and manages the prize pool. At the end of the game, winnings are distributed according to a predefined distribution model, such as 70% to the winner, 20% to the app owner, and 10% to the smart contract.
- **Game History and Leaderboards**: Game history, including moves, outcomes, and player statistics, is stored for future reference. Leaderboards showcase top-performing players based on various metrics such as win percentage and rating.
- **User Profiles and Achievements**: User profiles display player statistics, game history, and achievements. Players are rewarded with achievements for reaching milestones and accomplishing specific objectives.
- **Chat and Communication**: In-game chat functionality allows players to communicate during gameplay. Real-time updates notify players of their opponent's moves and game notifications.

### Technical Requirements

- **Blockchain and Smart Contracts**: The application utilizes the Ethereum blockchain for smart contract deployment and transaction handling. Smart contracts are written in Solidity, following security and efficiency best practices.
- **Front-end Development**: Modern web technologies like React.js are used for front-end development. The user interface is responsive and user-friendly, ensuring an optimal user experience. Integration with Ethereum wallet providers, such as Metamask, facilitates transaction handling.
- **Back-end and Server**: A scalable backend server handles authentication, game room management, and real-time updates. The server is capable of managing multiple concurrent game sessions efficiently.
- **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Thorough testing of smart contracts is conducted using frameworks like Truffle or Solidity testing libraries. Front-end components and game functionality are comprehensively tested. Security audits and code reviews are performed to ensure the integrity and safety of the application.

### Project Timeline and Deliverables

**Phase 1: Design and Planning**
- Gather requirements and define the project scope.
- Create wireframes and UI/UX design.
- Finalize the project plan and development approach.

**Phase 2: Smart Contract Development**
- Develop and test smart contracts for game logic and transactions.
- Implement payment and prize distribution mechanisms.

**Phase 3: Front-end Development**
- Create user interfaces and implement chess gameplay functionality.
- Integrate with Ethereum wallet providers for transaction handling.
- Implement chat and communication features.

**Phase 4: Backend Development and Server Setup**
- Set up the backend server to handle authentication and game room management.
- Establish real-time updates between players and game sessions


**Phase 5: Testing and Quality Assurance**
- Conduct thorough testing of smart contracts, front-end components, and overall functionality.
- Address any issues or bugs discovered during testing.
- Perform security audits and code reviews.

**Phase 6: Deployment and Launch**
- Deploy the application to the Ethereum mainnet.
- Make the application available for users to access and play.
- Conduct user acceptance testing and refine the application based on user feedback.

### Conclusion

The Blockchain Multiplayer Chess Game project combines the strategic game of chess with the transparency and security of blockchain technology. By following the outlined requirements and project plan, the development team can create a robust and engaging chess gaming platform that offers a unique and decentralized experience for players.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
